## 📖Description

I would like to invite you to take a look at my **"To do list"** application.

**"To do list"** is a web application which allows you to create a list of tasks that need to be done in the near future.

At the top of application you can see a navigation toolbar which can take you to tasks page or to an author page.

**1️ `Tasks adding block`**

In this block you can add as many tasks as you want or download example tasks by clicking "Get example tasks" button. Tasks will be listed below - in the "Tasks list block". 🖊️

**2️ `Search bar block`**

This specific block enables you to filter tasks. 🔍

**3️ `Tasks list block`**

Within this block all the tasks are generated. You can go to the subpage of each task by clicking on its content. 🗒️

There are two types of buttons next to each task:

- green button allows you to mark the task as completed or not ✅
- red button with trash icon is used to remove specific task from the board 🗑️.

Moreover, when you type tasks in the list, two additional functionalities appear - you can either hide completed tasks, complete all the tasks listed below or delete all tasks.
